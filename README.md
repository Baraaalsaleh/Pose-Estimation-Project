# Pose-Estimation-Project
In this project we try to estimate the pose of an object in the 3D-space using images and depth information acquired using Intel Realsense from only 6 different views of the object. We process these data using opencv and keep a description file for the object that can be used later as a reference for the pose estimation process.

This was a part of a the project "Image Processing Based Low Cost and Compact Robotic Control System Design for Object Discrimination and Collection Application" which was done by:

    - Ahmet NASRİ
    - Baraa ALSALEH
    - Muhammed SAATİ
    - Dr. Abdulkadir ŞANLI

This project was supported by TÜBITAK-2209B.
